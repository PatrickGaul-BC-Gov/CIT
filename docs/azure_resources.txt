# Azure resources in production and their usage:
acraf6z1jmd - The Container Registry.  This is the place the docker files that GitHub Actions creates. Generally this will hold the containers used for CIT-API and CIT-WEB

api-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - This is the "App Service" which is the an implementation of the docker image for API backend.
api-cit3-citz-bcgov-test

citapi (acraf6z1jmd/citapi) - The webhook used to reference the Container Registry.
citapiprod (acraf6z1jmd/citapiprod)

clnpdictprbi01 - This is the Power BI Embedded resource used as a connector for PowerBI Cloud

psql-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - the prod and following test PSQL databases actively used.
psql-cit3-citz-bcgov

tfstatecit - Storage to hold the Terraform state files.  These are important and should be preserved.

web-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - this is the web service actively used for the frontend.
web-cit3-citz-bcgov


# Resources no longer needed or unknown
cit-data-pipeline         - This is an obsolete container instance and should be removed once the GitHub Action Data pipeline has been validated to work as expected.
cit-data-pipeline-prod

cit-dev-lab-vnet          - the Virtual Network associated with the lab VMs - likely unneeded.
cit-dev1 (cit-devtest-lab1/cit-dev1) - The lab virtual machine.  Likely unused/no longer needed
cit-devtest-lab1

cit-email-notifications     - A logic App - seems to have been used for email service.  not sure it's used any longer. Needs to be verified.
cit-email-notifications-prod

cit-email-reminders - Container instances for sending emails.  I think this was replaced with the Common Hosted Email Service (CHES)
cit-email-reminders-prod

cit-idir-tracking-prod - Containers and VMs used for tracking IDIR. Again, I think this has been obsoleted but needs to be verified.
cit-idir-tracking

citdevtestlab19876 - Key Vault - unused - comes be default with the Resource Group

citpipelinedata - Storage for data files. This should have been obsoleted in Phase4 of the project.  It's unclear if this data (and hence storage) is still required.

citshell - log storage for instances.  Expected it's no longer needed.
citshel2

Dtlcit-devtest-lab1 - obsolete network for the lab

key-cit3-citz-bcgov-test - no longer needed - never fully implemented

cit-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - This appears to be an obsolete app service no longer used.
cit-cit3-citz-bcgov-test

#Azure lock information

In Azure, there is a lock on the resource group that prevents you from deleting resources
in the resource group. It also prevents you, for example, deleting ip addresses that you have
allowed through the postgres firewall. There is a workaround around this if needed, an admin
user can delete the lock temporarily that currently exists in the "locks" section at the resource
group level. Before deleting the lock, you should copy the inforation/names in all the fields so 
that when you recreate it, you can populate the fields back with the same information. AFter
deleting the lock, you can delete the information needed, and then recreate the lock
again.

The lock to delete is called DoNotDelete-RG. Be very careful when this lock is not in place to
not delete anything that you shouldnt.
