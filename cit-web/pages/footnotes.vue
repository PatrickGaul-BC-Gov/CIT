        <h4>Northern Rockies</h4>
        <p>
          The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality is included in our data as
          a "Regional District," even though it is technically a regional
          municipality, and not a regional district. The shape of this "regional
          district" was imported from the

        <h4>Latitude/Longitude of Location Assets</h4>
        <p>
          The latitudes and longitudes of location assets are set to the
          latitudes and longitudes provided in the source data whenever
          available. When there is no latitude/longitude in the source data but
          a municipality field is present, if there is a community in our
          communities list matching the municipality field we set the location
          asset's latitude/longitude to that of the community.

        <h4>Distance Calculations</h4>
        <p>
          We calculated driving distances and driving times using the
          <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-route-planner"
            >BC Route Planner API</a
          >. We only calculate driving distances where the birds' eye distance
          is within 50 km between location assets and communities, OR the
          distances between the nearest location asset of each type for a
          community if none are within 50 km.

        <h4>Search Filters Distances</h4>
        <p>
          The search filters for local assets on the Explore page use driving
          distance or driving time (based on road information) when available.
          This means that some local assets might be excluded from the search
          results when searching by driving time, even if they "should" be
          within the selected range. This could happen if a local asset and a
          community are separated by a body of water (i.e. there are no
          connecting roads between them). However, when filtering by driving
          distance, the search will fall back to birds' eye (straight line)
          distances whenever driving distances are unavailable.

        <h4>Statistics Canada Census Subdivisions data</h4>
        <p>
          Demographic data is sourced from Statistics Canada at the subdivision
          level. This means that data from unincorporated communities may
          actually apply to surrounding area containing several other small
          communities.

        <p>
          In the family structure chart, the following fields from
          <a href="#census-subdivisions">Statistics Canada</a> are being used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "All families" uses the "Total number of census families in private
            households - 100% data" field.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Married" uses the "Total couple families" field in the "Total
            number of census families in private households - 100% data"
            category.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Couple + Children" uses the "Couples with children" field in the
            "Total - Couple census families in private households - 100% data"
            category.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Single Parent" uses the "Total - Lone-parent census families in
            private households - 100% data" field.

        <h4>Renter and Owner Households</h4>
        <p>
          The charts and statistics shown in the renters and owners section
          apply to renter and owner <em>households</em>, and not individuals. In
          addition, the pie chart showing proportions of renters and owners
          refers to the number of households that are renter households or owner
          households. A caveat of the average monthly shelter cost statistics is
          that it is actually an average of averagesâ€”it is taking the average of
          the "average monthly shelter cost" field over census subdivisions
          corresponding to selected communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The percentage of average number of dwellings needing repairs is
          calculated using the "Total - Private households by household size -
          100% data" field as the total.

        <h4>Population</h4>
        <p>
          The Average Population statistic is an average (mean) of the
          population of census subdivisions corresponding to the selected
          communities.

        <h4>Transport Status (High Capacity Transport Services)</h4>
        <p>
          The distance filter for facilities uses driving distance based on road
          information when available, and falls back to birds' eye (straight
          line) distance otherwise. (For example, if a facility and a community
          are separated by a body of water, driving distance will not be
          available.)

            href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E"
            >Statistics Canada 2016 Census Profile</a
          >. Census data is captured every 5 years and may be outdated, and may
          not be able to capture recent trends or seasonal variations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communities whose corresponding Census Subdivisions that are missing
          more than 25% of the census fields that we use are flagged as having
          incomplete census data. The charts in the reports are calculated based
          on available data and some charts may be blank or may not represent
          all communities (if viewing aggregate reports in the Explore page). If
          all communities in the selection are missing over 25% of their census
          fields (or on the community detail page), some reports are hidden due
          to insufficient data.

        <h4>Median Income</h4>
        <p>
          Median income data from the Stats Canada web service are used to
          represent the income in communities enclosed in each census
          subdivision. When taken in aggregate on various reports, this means
          the average income shown is not the population-weighted average for
          all people included in the community (although that would be
          preferable). It is the average of median community incomes, loaded
          from
